                    The modern features like an electric starter, disc brakes have made it much easier to ride than the previous generation Royal Enfield bikes. Owning a Royal Enfield in earlier days required skills but not anymore. They have become much more conventional too. Earlier, the gear-lever was put on the right-hand side but now it has been shifted to the left-hand side, making it much easier to use. This also attracts a lot of buyers who stayed away from the brand.</div>

                <div class="main2_content_div1"> <h2>More spending power</h2>
                    The Royal Enfield motorcycles are quite expensive. While the economy is growing, the spending power of the youths is also increasing. People who would have settled for a much affordable bike in the past due to limited funds are going out and getting what they want. The increased spending power means that the young ones are getting the products that they always liked. </div>

                <div class="main2_content_div2"> <h2>Innovation</h2> 
                Royal Enfield may be termed as an obsolete brand by many critics but they are one brand who have entered a few all-new segments in India. Royal Enfield launched the first affordable cafe racer of India known as the Continental GT. The bike did not become very popular but it did keep the onlookers on their toes. It was an attractive product. Royal Enfield then launched the Himalayan, Indiaâ€™s most affordable adventure motorcycle, that again created ripples among the enthusiasts. </div>
